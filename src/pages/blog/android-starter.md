Hey there, welcome Again!

## Let's see how can we create an Android project.

This lesson shows you how to create a new Android project with Android Studio, and it describes some of the files in the project.

To create your new Android project, follow these steps:

1. Install the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. **In the Welcome to Android Studio** window, click **Create New Project.**

   **Figure 1.** Android Studio welcome screen.<br>
   â€¢ If you have a project already opened, select **File > New > New Project.**

3. In the **Select a Project Template** window, select **Empty Activity** and click **Next.**
4. In the **Configure your project** window, complete the following:<br>
   â€¢ Enter "My First App" in the **Name** field.<br>
   â€¢ Enter "com.example.myfirstapp" in the **Package name field.**<br>
   â€¢ If you'd like to place the project in a different folder, change its **Save** location.<br>
   â€¢ Select either **Java** or **Kotlin** from the **Language** drop-down menu.<br>
   â€¢ Select the lowest version of Android you want your app to support in the **Minimum SDK** field.<br>
   â€¢ If your app will require legacy library support, mark the **Use legacy android.support libraries** checkbox.<br>
   â€¢ Leave the other options as they are.
5. Click **Finish**.<br>
   After some processing time, **the Android Studio main window** appears.

Now take a moment to review the most important files.

First, be sure the **Project** window is open (select **View > Tool Windows > Project**) and the Android view is selected from the drop-down list at the top of that window. You can then see the following files:

**â€¢ app > java > com.example.myfirstapp > MainActivity**
This is the main activity. It's the entry point for your app. When you build and run your app, the system launches an instance of this [`Activity`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity) and loads its layout.

**â€¢ app > res > layout > activity_main.xml**
This XML file defines the layout for the activity's user interface (UI). It contains a [`TextView`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TextView) element with the text "Hello, World!"

**â€¢ app > manifests > AndroidManifest.xml**
The [manifest file](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro) describes the fundamental characteristics of the app and defines each of its components.

**â€¢ Gradle Scripts > build.gradle**
There are two files with this name: one for the project, "Project: My_First_App," and one for the app module, "Module: My_First_App.app." Each module has its own `build.gradle` file, but this project currently has just one module. Use each module's `build.gradle` file to control how the [Gradle plugin](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin) builds your app. For more information about this file, see [Configure your build](https://developer.android.com/studio/build#module-level).

And there you have it, **You** have successfuly created an Android Project... flex'em ðŸ’ª

The <strong style="color:#0E59B4">Help me choose</strong>  link opens the <strong style="color:#0E59B4"> Android Platform/API Version Distribution</strong> dialog. This dialog provides information about the various versions of Android that are distributed among devices. The key tradeoff to consider is the percentage of Android devices you want to support versus the amount of work to maintain your app on each of the different versions that those devices run on. For example, if you choose to make your app compatible with many different versions of Android, you increase the effort that's required to maintain compatibility between the oldest and newest versions.
